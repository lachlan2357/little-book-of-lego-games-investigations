# LEGO Star Wars: The Video Game - Handheld Version

Most platforms got the original game. From the investigation into release dates, we know the following platforms got a full release[^investigation_release_dates]:

- [Windows]
- [Mac]
- [Xbox]
- [PlayStation 2]
- [GameCube]

However, like many games, there were handheld versions of the game: not ports, separate games. My investigations into them are as follows:

## GameBoy Advance

The most notable of these handheld versions is for the [GameBoy Advance]. As seen through a longplay of it on [YouTube], it is a completely different game[^youtube_lego_star_wars_i_gba_longplay]. Luckily, the longplay also contains the opening legal screens where a lot of information is handy[^youtube_lego_star_wars_i_gba_longplay]:

- Producer: [Giant Interactive Entertainment]
- Developer: [Griptonite Games]
- Others somehow involved: [Eidos Interactive], [LucasArts]

As we know from the investigation into the publishers for [LEGO Star Wars: The Video Game], [LucasArts] didn't seem to be involved on the consumer-end, just providing licensing and assets, as nothing appears on their website from the time[^investigation_publishers].

We also know, briefly mentioned in the investigation into the release dates, the [GameBoy Advance] version was released in North America alongside the official game, both published by [Eidos Interactive] and to be released `2005-04-02`[^investigation_release_dates].

We also also know from a captured version of the [Eidos Interactive] UK game page for [LEGO Star Wars: The Video Game] dated `2005-03-07` confirms the release date for the [GameBoy Advance] as `2005-04-22` with the rest of the PAL versions[^eidos_uk_lego_star_wars_i_game_page].

We also also also know (I promise that's the last one) from the investigation into the release dates, the [GameBoy Advance] release for [NTSC/J] was with the [PlayStation 2] release on `2005-07-07`

So, we pretty much have all the pieces. We know [Griptonite Games] developed it, [Giant Interactive Entertainment] produced/published it and [Eidos Interactive] distributed it.

## Java ME

Then there's this game: just called *LEGO Star Wars* by [Universomo] with no mention of platform or anything[^universomo_lego_star_wars_episode_3]. Their company is described as producing games with:

> "... short time-to-market for Java, BREW, Symbian and other mobile platforms."

So, when they refer to "mobile" platforms, they mean old button-phones ("dumb phones", if you will).

Having a look on [YouTube], there is some actual gameplay footage of it[^youtube_lego_star_wars_mobile_three_levels][^youtube_lego_star_wars_mobile_game_over][^youtube_lego_star_wars_mobile_compilation].

Apparently, a website called [Dedomil] hosts a download for the `.jad` and `.jar` files for the game for different screen sizes[^dedomil_lego_star_wars_mobile]. I haven't checked them out for myself, however, so for all I know these could be viruses.

The accompany of a `.jad` file suggests this game was created for the [Java ME] platform, which makes sense considering the target for the game. But now we know slightly more about the game, we can look around for a release date.

Judging the the first capture of [Universomo]'s games page, the game had been released by `2006-05-04`[^universomo_games_page], which makes sense considering the main game released a year prior. There is a review of the game dated `2006-02-22`[^pocketgamer_lego_star_wars_i_mobile_review] so it is assumed to have been released by then. The Finish page for [Universomo] states the game would be available "End of 2005"[^universomo_fl_lego_star_wars_mobile_game_page].

The very first capture of [Universomo]'s press releases dated `2006-05-04` shows a press release for the game published `2005-11-30` says:

> "he mobile game is developed by Universomo and will be published by TT Games at the end of 2005."[^universomo_press_releases]

Now we have a publisher. Probably. Well, you see I can't find any direct evidence they did publish it, but since [Giant Interactive Entertainment] had the exclusive rights to LEGO interactively[^investigation_publishers], then it almost certainly was them.

What is slightly concerning, however, is a page with screenshots of the game, with a screenshot of it's about page saying `v1.6.2` was built (possible released? I don't know for sure) in October 2005[^narod_lego_star_wars_mobile_screenshots]. This could be fine, provided this is a build date and distribution happened after, but I don't know for sure.

According to the US [THQ Wireless] page for the game, to get it, you'd text `SW009` to `84746` to buy the game[^thq_wireless_lego_star_wars_i_game_page], but apart from that, I don't know any of the specifics of how it was distributed. The first archive of the page is from `2007` and doesn't mention release dates or anything, so that remains unknown.
