# LEGO Star Wars: The Video Game - Publishers

The publishers of [LEGO Star Wars: The Video Game] varies between versions of the game, but even for the same version, different sources claim different publishers (or even developers).

But to get to the bottom, we've gotta start at the top.

## So, who actually Developed the Game?

This might seem like an easy answer, but it's not so clear. The LEGO game series was developed by [TT Games], right? Their website would lead you to believe that since each of the games, including [LEGO Star Wars: The Video Game], is listed as their own[^tt_games_all_games]. However, going back in time, some discrepancies emerge.

According to an interview Jon Burton did with [Game Developer]:

> "The key management people at Lego Interactive started a small publishing company, then called Giant Interactive, to produce the game,"
>
> "That company had the exclusive rights to Lego interactively."
>
> "... we realised that we could work very well with Giant Interactive and a developer driven publisher could be a very nimble and effective organization."
>
> "... we bought Giant Interactive and it’s working out pretty well!"[^game_developer_interview_jon_burton]

It appears around the time of the release of [LEGO Star Wars: The Video Game], [Traveller's Tales] and [Giant Interactive Entertainment] merged into [TT Games]. This is confirmed by the first archived capture of [TT Games]'s official website's about page, which states:

> "TT Games was established in 2005 with the merger of publisher Giant Interactive and the developer Traveller's Tales"[^tt_games_history_2007]

However, there seems to be a contradiction further down the page. On one hand, [LEGO Star Wars: The Video Game] is listed under "Previous Games From Traveller's Tales", however this statement appears at the bottom of the overview:

> "The first title to come from the TT Games partnership was the award winning LEGO Star Wars: The Videogame."[^tt_games_history_2007]

So, which is it? Did [LEGO Star Wars: The Video Game] predate the merger, or the other way around? I guess we've gotta find when they merged.

### Traveller's Tales Website

[Traveller's Tales] (not [TT Games]) had an official website which has been mostly archived by [The Wayback Machine] between 2001 and 2006 before all it served was a redirect page to [TT Games].

There was a period of time between the release of [LEGO Star Wars: The Video Game] and when the website was first archived to be more of an advertisement of [TT Games]. The final capture of these is dated `2005-10-01` and interestingly does not feature any mention of the game[^travellers_tales_home_page_2005].

### Giant Interactive Entertainment Website

According to [The Wayback Machine], [Giant Interactive Entertainment]'s website did not change between the first capture dated `2005-11-24` and last capture dated `2010-01-10`. That first capture (which is identical to all others) doesn't feature any information about any games[^giant_interactive_entertainment_website_2005], but does have it's main image as this:

![Giant Interactive Entertainment Hero Image](https://web.archive.org/web/20070712065301im_/http://www.giantentertainment.com/images/main_image.jpg)

This is clearly for [LEGO Star Wars: The Video Game], but still does not answer any questions about whether they published the game as themselves or under [TT Games].

### Tracking Down the Merger

All mergers should have paperwork to go with it, right?

Well, like many countries, the UK, where [Traveller's Tales] is registered, keeps digital records of company filings and permits public access to them. As to be expected, both [Traveller's Tales] and [Giant Interactive Entertainment] has entity entries available, residing at:

-   [Traveller's Tales]: ID `03149992`
-   [Giant Interactive Entertainment]: ID `04946940`

According to the filings from both companies, [Traveller's Tales] underwent changes to become [TT Games], including directors joining and leaving where applicable. [Giant Interactive Entertainment] was sold to [TT Games] to become a subsidiary[^gov_uk_travellers_tales][^gov_uk_giant_interactive_entertainment]. According to both sets of filings, this merger happened on `2005-04-07`[^gov_uk_travellers_tales][^gov_uk_giant_interactive_entertainment].

This puts us at an interesting point. Using information from both [Traveller's Tales] filings[^gov_uk_travellers_tales] and [Giant Interactive Entertainment] filings[^gov_uk_giant_interactive_entertainment], this is the timeline of events:

-   `1996-01-23`: [Traveller's Tales] (then *CurrentClass*) was incorporated[^gov_uk_tt_games_incorporation]
-   `1996-03-15`: [Traveller's Tales] (then *CurrentClass*) changed names to *Travellers Tales*[^gov_uk_tt_games_change_name]
-   `2003-10-29`: [Giant Interactive Entertainment] (then *Oval (1925)*) was incorporated[^gov_uk_giant_interactive_entertainment_incorporation]
-   `2004-03-01`: [Giant Interactive Entertainment] (then *Oval (1925)*) changed names to *Get-Go-Games*[^gov_uk_giant_interactive_entertainment_change_name_get_go_games]
-   `2004-04-26`: [Giant Interactive Entertainment] (then *Get-Go-Games*) changed names to *Giant Interactive Entertainment*[^gov_uk_giant_interactive_entertainment_change_name]
-   `2005-04-07`: [Giant Interactive Entertainment] was completely acquired by [TT Games][^uk_gov_giant_interactive_entertainment_acquired]
-   `2005-04-07`: [Traveller's Tales] was completely acquired by [TT Games][^uk_gov_travellers_tales_acquired]
-   `2006-01-25`: [Giant Interactive Entertainment] changed names to *TT Games Publishing*[^uk_gov_giant_interactive_entertainment_change_name_tt_games_publishing]

Note that further investigations into the company layout can be found in their side investigation page[^side_investigation_tt_company_structure].

This puts our breakpoint between [Traveller's Tales] with [Giant Interactive Entertainment] and [TT Games] on `2005-04-07`, which complicates things slightly. At face value, we should be able to sort all the releases to ones before and after `2005-04-07` to determine whether they were developed by [Traveller's Tales] and published by [Giant Interactive Entertainment], or whether both were done by [TT Games]. Taking my research from my investigation about the release dates[^investigation_release_dates], that means the following:

| Platform        | Region      | Release Date | Developer           | Publisher                         |
|:---------------:|:-----------:|:------------:|:-------------------:|:---------------------------------:|
| [Windows]       | [Worldwide] | `2005-04-02` | [Traveller's Tales] | [Giant Interactive Entertainment] |
| [Mac]           | [Worldwide] | `2005-08-22` | -                   | -                                 |
| [Xbox]          | [NTSC/NC]   | `2005-04-05` | [Traveller's Tales] | [Giant Interactive Entertainment] |
| [Xbox]          | [PAL]       | `2005-04-22` | [TT Games]          | [TT Games]                        |
| [PlayStation 2] | [NTSC/NC]   | `2005-04-02` | [Traveller's Tales] | [Giant Interactive Entertainment] |
| [PlayStation 2] | [NTSC/J]    | `2005-07-07` | [TT Games]          | [TT Games]                        |
| [PlayStation 2] | [PAL]       | `2005-04-22` | [TT Games]          | [TT Games]                        |
| [GameCube]      | [NTSC/NC]   | `2005-10-25` | [TT Games]          | [TT Games]                        |
| [GameCube]      | [PAL]       | `2005-11-04` | [TT Games]          | [TT Games]                        |

This is true for the original releases, however any re-releases (or repackaging) may always state [TT Games] for both roles. As this dataset currently only worries about initial releases, this is fine, however does not paint the entire picture without this investigation.

### Verification

We can try lookup box images for different versions to see whether this is accurate. First port of call is [The Internet Archive], with the following entries for box art:

-   German Xbox Release[^internet_archive_lego_star_wars_i_german_xbox_disc] ([PAL], at least `2005-04-22`) states [Traveller's Tales] and [Giant Interactive Entertainment]

And this already proves this wrong. There are more, too

-   US Windows Re-Release[^internet_archive_lego_star_wars_i_us_windows_re_release] (unknown date) states [Traveller's Tales] and [Giant Interactive Entertainment]
-   US PlayStation 2 Release[^internet_archive_lego_star_wars_i_us_playstation_2_release] ([NTSC/NC], at least `2005-04-02`) states [Traveller's Tales] and [Giant Interactive Entertainment]
-   US Xbox Release[^internet_archive_lego_star_wars_i_us_xbox_release] ([NTSC/NC], at least `2005-04-05`) states [Traveller's Tales] and [Giant Interactive Entertainment]
-   US PlayStation 2 Greatest Hits Release[^internet_archive_lego_star_wars_i_us_playstation_2_greatest_hits_release] ([NTSC/NC], unknown date) states [TT Games]
-   US Xbox Platinum Family Hits Release[^internet_archive_lego_star_wars_i_us_xbox_platinum_family_hits_release] ([NTSC/NC], unknown date) states [TT Games]
-   EU Windows Release[^internet_archive_lego_star_wars_i_eu_windows_release] (unknown date) states [Traveller's Tales] and [Giant Interactive Entertainment]

So, it appears that theory was wrong. Judging by this information, all initial releases, no matter the platform or region, were credited to [Traveller's Tales] and [Giant Interactive Entertainment], however the edition re-releases ([PlayStation 2] Greatest Hits, [Xbox] Platinum Family Hits, etc.) were credited to [TT Games]. Since [Xbox]'s Platinum Hits required a game to be on sale for nine months[^ign_xbox_platinum_hits], and [PlayStation 2]'s Greatest Hits to be on sale for a year[^playstation_greatest_hits], this seems to solve the contradiction. For the original line (no special editions re-prints), [Traveller's Tales] was the developer and [Giant Interactive Entertainment] was the publisher.

For all except one.

## The Mac

Ah, the Mac. As we found out in that release date investigation, the [Mac] release was different as it was developed by [i5works] and published by [Aspyr Media]. That sorts out the developer and publisher, right? Actually, yeah. Except that there should be two developers: [Traveller's Tales] for the original and [i5works] for the port since the version for the [Mac] was indeed the full game; MacWorld described the game as "\[their\] Mac conversion"[^macworld_lego_star_wars_i_beta].

## So Far, So Good

As of now, we have the following:

| Platform        | Region      | Release Date | Developers                     | Publishers                        |
| --------------- | ----------- | ------------ | ------------------------------ | --------------------------------- |
| [Windows]       | [Worldwide] | `2005-04-02` | [Traveller's Tales]            | [Giant Interactive Entertainment] |
| [Mac]           | [Worldwide] | `2005-08-22` | [Traveller's Tales], [i5works] | [Aspyr Media]                     |
| [Xbox]          | [NTSC/NC]   | `2005-04-05` | [Traveller's Tales]            | [Giant Interactive Entertainment] |
| [Xbox]          | [PAL]       | `2005-04-22` | [Traveller's Tales]            | [Giant Interactive Entertainment] |
| [PlayStation 2] | [NTSC/NC]   | `2005-04-02` | [Traveller's Tales]            | [Giant Interactive Entertainment] |
| [PlayStation 2] | [NTSC/J]    | `2005-07-07` | [Traveller's Tales]            | [Giant Interactive Entertainment] |
| [PlayStation 2] | [PAL]       | `2005-04-22` | [Traveller's Tales]            | [Giant Interactive Entertainment] |
| [GameCube]      | [NTSC/NC]   | `2005-10-25` | [Traveller's Tales]            | [Giant Interactive Entertainment] |
| [GameCube]      | [PAL]       | `2005-11-04` | [Traveller's Tales]            | [Giant Interactive Entertainment] |

Which is all good, right?

Right?

## Publishers vs Distributors

Remember that earlier interview with Jon Burton? It also said this:

> "At the moment we have to partner with other publishers for distribution, which dilutes our brand."[^game_developer_interview_jon_burton]

...

So, even though [Giant Interactive Entertainment] was the publisher, it wasn't necessarily the distributor. This can be verified by all those box-art archives for above which all including the logo for [Eidos Interactive].

So, which versions did [Eidos Interactive] distribute? All of the, except the [Mac] version which was seemingly all handled by [Aspyr Media]. So, let's make our table complete:

| Platform        | Region      | Release Date | Developers                     | Publishers                        | Distributors        |
| --------------- | ----------- | ------------ | ------------------------------ | --------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| [Windows]       | [Worldwide] | `2005-04-02` | [Traveller's Tales]            | [Giant Interactive Entertainment] | [Eidos Interactive] |
| [Mac]           | [Worldwide] | `2005-08-22` | [Traveller's Tales], [i5works] | [Aspyr Media]                     | -                   |
| [Xbox]          | [NTSC/NC]   | `2005-04-05` | [Traveller's Tales]            | [Giant Interactive Entertainment] | [Eidos Interactive] |
| [Xbox]          | [PAL]       | `2005-04-22` | [Traveller's Tales]            | [Giant Interactive Entertainment] | [Eidos Interactive] |
| [PlayStation 2] | [NTSC/NC]   | `2005-04-02` | [Traveller's Tales]            | [Giant Interactive Entertainment] | [Eidos Interactive] |
| [PlayStation 2] | [NTSC/J]    | `2005-07-07` | [Traveller's Tales]            | [Giant Interactive Entertainment] | [Eidos Interactive] |
| [PlayStation 2] | [PAL]       | `2005-04-22` | [Traveller's Tales]            | [Giant Interactive Entertainment] | [Eidos Interactive] |
| [GameCube]      | [NTSC/NC]   | `2005-10-25` | [Traveller's Tales]            | [Giant Interactive Entertainment] | [Eidos Interactive] |
| [GameCube]      | [PAL]       | `2005-11-04` | [Traveller's Tales]            | [Giant Interactive Entertainment] | [Eidos Interactive] |

## Is this all Final?

Maybe. It's quite possible I've missed something, or that there is incorrect information, but I believe this is the most accurate information based on my research.

## Remaining Questions

1. [LucasArts] is often cited as a publisher, however I cannot find any information that concludes this is even a possibility. Their website from the time, this capture dated `2005-05-07` (after the game had been out for around a month), doesn't even mention the game's existence[^lucasarts_all_games_2005], so there is little chance they were a publisher.
