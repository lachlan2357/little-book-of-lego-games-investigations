# LEGO Star Wars: The Video Game - Release Dates

Many online sources claim different release dates for [LEGO Star Wars: The Video Game]. Considering the video game landscape of 2005, and that technology was in a much more limited and fragmented state compared to today, this is to be expected.

What makes this question difficult to answer comes down to a few factors:

- the age of this game means some companies involved, including their websites, either don't exist anymore of have moved on from the game, making the [The Wayback Machine] an invaluable but incomplete resource.
- like many other games in the early 2000s, many games released at different times for different platforms in different regions, not only giving uncertainty, but variability to the times and dates.
- many outlets don't cite their sources at all, making claims very hard to validate.

With all of that said, if this question is truly to be answered, we've gotta start somewhere, right?

## Versions of LEGO Star Wars: The Video Game

To know what to look for, we've got to know what exists, which includes knowing what platforms and regions the game actually launched in.

Through developer/distributor websites, documented through my investigation into the publishers of the game, I've found the following full game releases of the game (not handheld versions)[^investigation_publishers]:

-   [Windows]
-   [Mac]
-   [Xbox]
-   [PlayStation 2]
-   [GameCube]

### Differences between Regions

Some consoles, especially older ones, had region locking, restricting which games can be played on a console to those sold in the same region as the console. While this practice has become less common in recent console generations, with the [Xbox One][^ign_xbox_one_no_region_lock], [PlayStation 3][^wired_playstation_3_no_region_lock] and [Nintendo Switch][^youtube_switch_no_region_lock] being the first where their manufacturers removed region locking from their consoles, all the consoles for [LEGO Star Wars: The Video Game] implemented region-locking, so we need to take that into consideration.

Both computer operating systems, [Windows] and [Mac], don't have any kind of region locking, so they aren't applicable, and any version can be played on them. They are designated with the [Worldwide] region.

Finally, an extensively-cited article from [IGN] claims that Japan was to receive the main [LEGO Star Wars: The Video Game] for the [PlayStation 2], with [Xbox] or [GameCube] remaining absent from the publication[^ign_lego_star_wars_i_japan_announcement]. This will be investigated, so for now let's assume they did get a release.

That brings the following releases into scope for this investigation:

-   [Windows] ([Worldwide])
-   [Mac] ([Worldwide])
-   [Xbox] ([NTSC/NC])
-   [Xbox] ([NTSC/J])
-   [Xbox] ([PAL])
-   [PlayStation 2] ([NTSC/NC])
-   [PlayStation 2] ([NTSC/J])
-   [PlayStation 2] ([PAL])
-   [GameCube] ([NTSC/NC])
-   [GameCube] ([NTSC/J])
-   [GameCube] ([PAL])

With these 11 release dates to find, let's get researching.

## First Release

As we discovered from the investigation into the publisher, [Eidos Interactive] handled distribution for the game in all regions but Japan[^investigation_publishers].
Knowing this, we can consult [Eidos Interactive]'s website for information about it's release.

Using [The Wayback Machine], the first capture of [Eidos Interactive]'s [LEGO Star Wars: The Video Game] game page is from `2005-20-03` in wherein it states the release date for the game to be "Spring 2005"[^eidos_interactive_lego_star_wars_i_game_page_march]. The next available capture shows the game to be "In Stores Now", missing the announcement of the date[^eidos_interactive_lego_star_wars_i_game_page_june].

It's clear this page wasn't visited and/or archived frequently, however a page that was, their home page, provides some useful information. Luckily for us, their home page highlights upcoming and recently released games. The first capture of the home page to include an entry for [LEGO Star Wars: The Video Game] is from `2005-01-31` where we see the game is "Coming Spring 2005"[^eidos_interactive_home_page_january]. This message remains until a capture dated `2005-03-23` states "2 April 2005"[^eidos_interactive_home_page_march]. This new message remains until the final capture of note dated `2005-04-14` where the message is now "In Stores Now"[^eidos_interactive_home_page_april], just as we saw on the game page from June.

This appears to give us confirmation of our first release date, but question remains for which platforms. Luckily on that main page from March, we can see the intended platforms[^eidos_interactive_home_page_march]: [Windows], [Xbox] and [PlayStation 2]. Since this version of their website is their regional page for the United States, as seen on their main page[^eidos_plc_main_page], we can start to fill in our entries:

| Platform        | Region      | Release Date | Source                               |
|:---------------:|:-----------:|:------------:|:------------------------------------:|
| [Windows]       | [Worldwide] | `2005-04-02` | [^eidos_interactive_home_page_march] |
| [Mac]           | [Worldwide] | -            | -                                    |
| [Xbox]          | [NTSC/NC]   | `2005-04-02` | [^eidos_interactive_home_page_march] |
| [Xbox]          | [NTSC/J]    | -            | -                                    |
| [Xbox]          | [PAL]       | -            | -                                    |
| [PlayStation 2] | [NTSC/NC]   | `2005-04-02` | [^eidos_interactive_home_page_march] |
| [PlayStation 2] | [NTSC/J]    | -            | -                                    |
| [PlayStation 2] | [PAL]       | -            | -                                    |
| [GameCube]      | [NTSC/NC]   | -            | -                                    |
| [GameCube]      | [NTSC/J]    | -            | -                                    |
| [GameCube]      | [PAL]       | -            | -                                    |

## There's just One Small Problem: The Xbox

All would be fine so far if it weren't for the Xbox release. In an [IGN Wire] article, on-or-before `2005-03-24`, the game went Gold[^ign_lego_star_wars_i_xbox_delayed], meaning primary development had completed. This makes sense considering it was around this time (with time-zone and capture shenanigans accounted for) [Eidos Interactive] first published the release date for the game. However, one line in this article complicates things:

> "The Video Game for PS2, PC, and GBA will be available in stores across North America on April 2, 2005 with the Xbox version soon to follow"[^ign_lego_star_wars_i_xbox_delayed]

Oh. Firstly, this confirms our [NTSC/NC] release for the other two platforms, however if [IGN] is to be believed, the [NTSC/NC] [Xbox] release was delayed.

So, let's try find it.

### IGN Xbox

At the time, [IGN] was sectioned-off based on platforms. Our previous source saying the [Xbox] release date was delayed was from [IGN Wire] which, as far as I can tell, focused more on general news rather than anything platform specific. [IGN Xbox], however, focused on [Xbox] releases, making this review[^ign_lego_star_wars_i_xbox_review] for [LEGO Star Wars: The Video Game] for [Xbox] interesting. Well, that article, yes, but that page, no.

You see, [IGN] has since merged it's operations together and no longer has distinct sections of their website dedicated to different platforms. So, this review currently sits under their general data-page[^ign_lego_star_wars_i] for [LEGO Star Wars: The Video Game]. However, if we find the same review as an archive, we see some interesting information.

The date `2005-04-05` appears twice; as the date the article was published and the claimed US release date in the sidebar[^ign_lego_star_wars_i_xbox_review_archived]. This makes sense, to me at least, considering something that has plagued the video game review landscape for a while: embargoes.

As explained in an article by [Kotaku], game publishers often come to agreements with review outlets where they provide game keys to reviewers on certain conditions[^kotaku_embargoes]. Despite some of the concerning examples [Kotaku] gave, one of the most common condition for an early key is that the review not be posted before a certain date[^kotaku_embargoes]. From what I've seen in recent times, this date is usually the release date of the project, likely to garner more sales compared to if there were a time difference between when consumers discover the game and when they can purchase it. Because of this, I believe it's likely [IGN Xbox] had an embargo with [Eidos Interactive] not to release their review for the game before it's official release date, which is why these two dates line up.

This is just speculation, however, and more evidence is necessary to prove this one way or another. So, I have gathered sources around the internet to see what they believe the release date to be:

| Site           | Claimed Release Date | Source                                       |
|:--------------:|:--------------------:|:--------------------------------------------:|
| [Xbox Fandom]  | `2005-03-29`         | [^xbox_fandom_lego_star_wars_i_release_date] |
| [Moby Games]   | `2005-03-30`         | [^moby_games_lego_star_wars_i_release_date]  |
| [GameFAQs]     | `2005-04-05`         | [^game_faqs_lego_star_wars_i_release_date]   |
| [GameSpy]\*    | `2005-04-05`         | [^game_spy_lego_star_wars_i_release_date]  |
| [IGDB]         | `2005-04-05`         | [^igdb_lego_star_wars_i_release_date]        |
| [IGN]          | `2005-04-05`         | [^ign_lego_star_wars_i_xbox_review_archived] |
| [The Xbox Hub] | `2005-04-05`         | [^xbox_hub_lego_star_wars_i_release_date]    |
| [XboxAddict]   | `2005-04-06`         | [^xbox_addict_lego_star_wars_i_release_date] |

\* states they are "powered by [IGN]"

None cite their data from anywhere, so these sources are somewhere between all independent and all [IGN]. Even though, there are four distinct claimed release dates:

-   `2005-03-29`
-   `2005-03-30`
-   `2005-04-05`
-   `2005-04-06`

The first two are fairly easy to disregard as even the first release hadn't happened yet. Out of the remaining two, the 5th is by far the most common date, with the 6th only appearing once.

So, it seems the most likely date for the [NTSC/NC] [Xbox] release is `2005-04-05`. This kind-of lines up with the [IGN Wire] article stating the release was "soon to follow"[^ign_lego_star_wars_i_xbox_delayed] as, at the time of publishing the article on `2005-03-24`, that may have been all that was known. My best guess is that the developers had trouble porting the game to Xbox, or issues with getting that version signed-off on by a higher entity.

Nevertheless, out table now looks like:

| Platform        | Region      | Release Date | Source                                       |
|:---------------:|:-----------:|:------------:|:--------------------------------------------:|
| [Windows]       | [Worldwide] | `2005-04-02` | [^eidos_interactive_home_page_march]         |
| [Mac]           | [Worldwide] | -            | -                                            |
| [Xbox]          | [NTSC/NC]   | `2005-04-05` | [^ign_lego_star_wars_i_xbox_review_archived] |
| [Xbox]          | [NTSC/J]    | -            | -                                            |
| [Xbox]          | [PAL]       | -            | -                                            |
| [PlayStation 2] | [NTSC/NC]   | `2005-04-02` | [^eidos_interactive_home_page_march]         |
| [PlayStation 2] | [NTSC/J]    | -            | -                                            |
| [PlayStation 2] | [PAL]       | -            | -                                            |
| [GameCube]      | [NTSC/NC]   | -            | -                                            |
| [GameCube]      | [NTSC/J]    | -            | -                                            |
| [GameCube]      | [PAL]       | -            | -                                            |

Let's keep on keeping-on.

## PAL Release

The [PAL] release was also handled by [Eidos Interactive], so we can visit a [PAL]-region sites to see what the release date was.

The first capture of their UK site home page to show [LEGO Star Wars: The Video Game] is dated `2005-02-05` in which it is stated the game is "Coming Soon"[^eidos_uk_home_page_february]. The first capture to change this dated `2005-03-12` displays "22nd April 2005" as the date[^eidos_uk_home_page_march], interestingly, this changed happened just under two weeks before the United States version's release date was announced, potentially because they had more time to work with, but who knows. This again changed in a newer capture dated `2005-04-29` "In Stores Now"[^eidos_uk_home_page_april].

We once again have a date for a release, but not the platforms. Unfortunately, [Eidos Interactive]'s UK game page is an embed of the official website[^eidos_uk_lego_star_wars_i_game_page], which is not archived in a functional manner[^lego_star_wars_i_main_page], so this does not help us at all. Luckily, again, the platforms are listed on the main page[^eidos_uk_home_page_april]: [Windows], [Xbox] and [PlayStation 2].

Do note, since the [Windows] version had already been released in the [Worldwide] region, I am not re-including it here as it more functions as the UK release rather than a [PAL].

However, just like last time, how can we be sure the [Xbox] release is accurate?

I haven't been able to find any [PAL]-region articles relating to [LEGO Star Wars: The Video Game]'s release date on [Xbox] and I'm not sure where exactly to look. I've tried some [PAL] gaming news websites from around the time, such as [GamesRadar] and [Kotaku]'s UK site, but I haven't been able to find anything. If my previous theory as to why the [Xbox] release was delayed is correct, this release should not have been, so sticking with the `2005-04-22` release date seems reasonable. So, let's add it to the table.

| Platform        | Region      | Release Date | Source                                       |
|:---------------:|:-----------:|:------------:|:--------------------------------------------:|
| [Windows]       | [Worldwide] | `2005-04-02` | [^eidos_interactive_home_page_march]         |
| [Mac]           | [Worldwide] | -            |                                              |
| [Xbox]          | [NTSC/NC]   | `2005-04-05` | [^ign_lego_star_wars_i_xbox_review_archived] |
| [Xbox]          | [NTSC/J]    | -            | -                                            |
| [Xbox]          | [PAL]       | `2005-04-22` | [^eidos_uk_home_page_march]                  |
| [PlayStation 2] | [NTSC/NC]   | `2005-04-02` | [^eidos_interactive_home_page_march]         |
| [PlayStation 2] | [NTSC/J]    | -            | -                                            |
| [PlayStation 2] | [PAL]       | `2005-04-22` | [^eidos_uk_home_page_march]                  |
| [GameCube]      | [NTSC/NC]   | -            | -                                            |
| [GameCube]      | [NTSC/J]    | -            | -                                            |
| [GameCube]      | [PAL]       | -            | -                                            |

## To Japan We Go!

As previously mentioned, an [IGN] article states that Japan would only receive the game for [PlayStation 2] (and the differently [GameBoy Advance] version)[^ign_lego_star_wars_i_japan_announcement] rather than also with [Windows] and [Xbox]. So, let's try and find those versions, if they exist.

### Ebay

I first tried searching [Ebay] for video games in [NTSC/J] and game name [LEGO Star Wars: The Video Game], only to get results for [PlayStation 2] and [GameBoy Advance]; just as that article stated.

### Amazon

I tried searching [Amazon] also to no avail; only showing [PlayStation 2] and [GameBoy Advance] versions.

### Eidos Japan

The first capture of [Eidos Interactive]'s Japan site game page to show [LEGO Star Wars: The Video Game], just like the UK site, is a broken embed of the official page[^lego_star_wars_i_main_page]. However, a capture of their main page shows the game in the header carousel with the following text (Google-translated from Japanese)[^eidos_japan_home_page_july]:

> "LEGO Star Wars GameBoy Advance and PlayStation 2 versions released on July 7th"[^eidos_japan_home_page_july]

So, that appears to confirm two things:

1. There was never a [NTSC/J] version of [LEGO Star Wars: The Video Game] for any platforms other than [PlayStation 2] and a handheld version for [GameBoy Advance].
2. The release date for these [NTSC/J] versions were both `2005-07-07`.

It is unfortunate that Japan didn't get an [Xbox] version, but makes sense considering Microsoft's struggles in Japan at the time[^ign_microsoft_japan_struggles].

Let's keep the table going, with one addition and one removal:

| Platform        | Region      | Release Date | Source                                       |
|:---------------:|:-----------:|:------------:|:--------------------------------------------:|
| [Windows]       | [Worldwide] | `2005-04-02` | [^eidos_interactive_home_page_march]         |
| [Mac]           | [Worldwide] | -            |                                              |
| [Xbox]          | [NTSC/NC]   | `2005-04-05` | [^ign_lego_star_wars_i_xbox_review_archived] |
| [Xbox]          | [PAL]       | `2005-04-22` | [^eidos_uk_home_page_march]                  |
| [PlayStation 2] | [NTSC/NC]   | `2005-04-02` | [^eidos_interactive_home_page_march]         |
| [PlayStation 2] | [NTSC/J]    | `2005-07-07` | [^eidos_japan_home_page_july]                |
| [PlayStation 2] | [PAL]       | `2005-04-22` | [^eidos_uk_home_page_march]                  |
| [GameCube]      | [NTSC/NC]   | -            | -                                            |
| [GameCube]      | [NTSC/J]    | -            | -                                            |
| [GameCube]      | [PAL]       | -            | -                                            |

## Let's Find the Game on the Cube

By all accounts, the [GameCube] version was released much later than the other platforms. This is most likely due to [Eidos Interactive] stopping publishing [GameCube] games in 2003 due to "a decrease in profitability"[^ign_eidos_interactive_stops_game_cube_games]. However, it was announced by [GamesIndustryBiz] on `2005-10-26` there would be a [GameCube] version of the game, reported in the same article to be releasing on `04-11-2005`[^games_industry_biz_lego_star_wars_i_game_cube]. As [GamesIndustryBiz] is a UK-based outlet[^games_industry_biz_about], this can be assumed as the [PAL] release, but what about the [NTSC/NC] and [NTSC/J] releases?

### Eidos Again

Somewhere between [Eidos Interactive]'s game page's the last capture not to feature the [GameCube], dated `2005-09-01`[^eidos_interactive_lego_star_wars_i_game_page_september], and the first capture to do so, dated `2005-12-10`[^eidos_interactive_lego_star_wars_i_game_page_december], is a whole three months. So, we at least know the [NTSC/NC] version is between those two dates.

While their home page capture, dated `2005-12-11` (just to be sure it's after the game page change), doesn't show the [GameCube] logo on the main content, it does in the sidebar[^eidos_interactive_home_page_december]. Considering the frequency of updates of the main page, we can fairly accurately get a release date ... right?.

I wish.

It appears [Eidos Interactive] updated their home page to include the [GameCube] release as soon as they announced they would distribute it. The first capture with the logo is dated `2005-10-26`[^eidos_interactive_home_page_october_26] while the previous capture is dated `2005-10-24`[^eidos_interactive_home_page_october_24]: two days prior. Since we don't have a game page for [LEGO Star Wars: The Video Game] from these dates, it's unknown if the [NTSC/NC] version released on the same day as the announcement, but since in January, before the game released at all, the sidebar showed all platforms, it can be assumed this is purely a "Coming Soon" addition. Except ...

### Return of ~~the Jedi~~ IGN

Once again we go to [IGN], this time where [IGN GameCube] released an article on `2005-10-25` that said:

> "Eidos announced today that the GameCube version of LEGO Star Wars: The Video Game, is now shipping in North America."[^ign_lego_star_wars_i_game_cube_release_archived]

The sidebar on the page also confirms that release date. This begs the question: why do we also have the `2005-11-04` date from the [GamesIndustryBiz] article? The answer definitely won't surprise you.

### The ~~Force~~ PAL Awakens

[Eidos Interactive]'s UK home page capture dated `2005-11-02` is far more helpful, stating "GameCube November 4th"[^eidos_uk_home_page_november]. If only their United States page was this useful.

### The Phantom ~~Menace~~ GameCube

Once again, it appears the [GameCube] drew the short straw. I cannot find any evidence there was a Japanese [GameCube] version of [LEGO Star Wars: The Video Game]. Which sucks.

## Consolidating the GameCube

After that investigation into the [GameCube], we've found it's release date for [NTSC/NC] and [PAL], and found it it didn't have a [NTSC/J] release, leaving our table at:

| Platform        | Region      | Release Date | Source                                             |
|:---------------:|:-----------:|:------------:|:--------------------------------------------------:|
| [Windows]       | [Worldwide] | `2005-04-02` | [^eidos_interactive_home_page_march]               |
| [Mac]           | [Worldwide] | -            |                                                    |
| [Xbox]          | [NTSC/NC]   | `2005-04-05` | [^ign_lego_star_wars_i_xbox_review_archived]       |
| [Xbox]          | [PAL]       | `2005-04-22` | [^eidos_uk_home_page_march]                        |
| [PlayStation 2] | [NTSC/NC]   | `2005-04-02` | [^eidos_interactive_home_page_march]               |
| [PlayStation 2] | [NTSC/J]    | `2005-07-07` | [^eidos_japan_home_page_july]                      |
| [PlayStation 2] | [PAL]       | `2005-04-22` | [^eidos_uk_home_page_march]                        |
| [GameCube]      | [NTSC/NC]   | `2005-10-25` | [^ign_lego_star_wars_i_game_cube_release_archived] |
| [GameCube]      | [PAL]       | `2005-11-04` | [^eidos_uk_home_page_november]                     |

This leaves one last thing:

## A New ~~Hope~~ Platform

Are these headings getting predicable yet? Anyway, the [Mac] release. Unlike the others, the [Mac] version wasn't solely developed by [Traveller's Tales]; a company called [i5works] seemingly developed the [Mac] port. They state the release date as "August 2005"[^i5works_games] but you already know we need to go deeper.

We have already learnt the game was published by somebody else: [Aspyr Media][^investigation_publishers]. Their game page doesn't show anything useful either[^aspyr_media_lego_star_wars_i_game_page].

[Aspyr Media] does have a newsletter, though, and it shows it was released after their August issue dated `2005-08-17`[^aspyr_media_newsletter_august] but before their September issue on `2005-09-29` where the game is stated to have been released[^aspyr_media_newsletter_september]. As we know it was published in August from [i5works], this window has narrowed to the last fourteen days at the end of August: `2005-08-17` to `2005-08-31`.

[Aspyr Media]'s game status page capture dated `2005-08-30` shows the game as being "In Stores"[^aspyr_media_game_statuses], knocking a day off the range. [MacWorld] announced in an article that [Aspyr Media] planned to release the game on `2005-08-22`[^macworld_lego_star_wars_i_mac_gold] which matches perfectly with the Aspyr's August newsletter also stating the game had gone gold and was ready to release. It seems extremely likely that [Aspyr Media] stuck to this date.

So, with that, we can add our final entry to the table.

## Putting a Bow On It

At the end of this quite lengthy investigation, here is the most accurate table of release dates I can assemble (with a comparison to what [Wikipedia] say added as a column):

| Platform        | Region      | Release Date | Source                                             | Wikipedia Release Date |
|:---------------:|:-----------:|:------------:|:--------------------------------------------------:|:----------------------:|
| [Windows]       | [Worldwide] | `2005-04-02` | [^eidos_interactive_home_page_march]               | `2005-03-29`           |
| [Mac]           | [Worldwide] | `2005-08-22` | [^macworld_lego_star_wars_i_mac_gold]              | `2005-08-22` \*\*      |
| [Xbox]          | [NTSC/NC]   | `2005-04-05` | [^ign_lego_star_wars_i_xbox_review_archived]       | `2005-04-05`           |
| [Xbox]          | [PAL]       | `2005-04-22` | [^eidos_uk_home_page_march]                        | `2005-04-22`           |
| [PlayStation 2] | [NTSC/NC]   | `2005-04-02` | [^eidos_interactive_home_page_march]               | `2005-03-29`           |
| [PlayStation 2] | [NTSC/J]    | `2005-07-07` | [^eidos_japan_home_page_july]                      | `2005-03-29` \*\*\*    |
| [PlayStation 2] | [PAL]       | `2005-04-22` | [^eidos_uk_home_page_march]                        | `2005-04-22`           |
| [GameCube]      | [NTSC/NC]   | `2005-10-25` | [^ign_lego_star_wars_i_game_cube_release_archived] | `2005-10-26`           |
| [GameCube]      | [PAL]       | `2005-11-04` | [^eidos_uk_home_page_november]                     | `2005-11-04`           |

\*\* `2005-09-07` stated as the PAL release? \
\*\*\* `2005-07-07` stated in the body of the article

The differences between my and [Wikipedia]'s findings are:

1. I don't believe the [Mac] version got region-releases considering the platform. It is potentially referencing the release in [PAL] regions, rather than a [PAL] version, but I'm not sure.
2. There is also no mention of the Japanese releases in the overview where the rest of the dates are, so reading that sidebar makes it seem like the Japanese release was with the first releases. That should probably be fixed.
3. Their [GameCube] release is a day later. Interestingly, their cited source[^ign_lego_star_wars_i_game_cube_release] is the same as my cited source[^ign_lego_star_wars_i_game_cube_release_archived], except mine is the archived version from 2005 which more specific information rather than the live version which appears to be doing some time-zone calculations to display, for me in Australia (GMT+10), that the article was posted `2005-10-27`: two days earlier than when it actually was.
4. Finally, I don't believe the `2005-03-29` release date for the first release is correct, despite what their IGN source[^ign_games_of_spring] and their WorthPlaying source[^worth_playing_lego_star_wars_i_ships] says as neither appear to have a direct official source unlike those I used.

Overall, I'm quite happy with these findings. Sure, some of the sources are from news outlets, but they feature the most compelling information I can find. At least it's better than [Wikipedia]'s attempt.
