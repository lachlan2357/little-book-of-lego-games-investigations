# New Content

It is fairly well known that [LEGO Star Wars: The Complete Saga] is mostly a re-release of the two previous games in a single package with minor tweaks here and there. However, there are some significant differences between the two games, which this investigation aims to document.

## Levels

Most of the levels are identical to their original counterparts, however some levels have been shifted around and new ones added or replaced old ones. However, as far as I can tell, none of the content from either previous game is missing from this.

### Mos Espa Podrace

This level, originally featured in [LEGO Star Wars: The Video Game] however was modified before it's inclusion in [LEGO Star Wars: The Complete Saga].

For starters, all sections of the race has timers associated with them. Each of the three laps are split into three distinct sections each with a timer that, if you didn't meet, would force you to replay that section. All but one of these aren't present in the new version, however you can still timeout the final race with Sebulba if you do not beat them.

Secondly, there was originally a scene transition when finishing each section of the course. There is a noticeable 2D image at the end of each section, however in the new version, the course is one entire scene and doesn't require any transitions.

Further, due to an assumed limitation of some kind, each new lap required a scene transition before starting. This wouldn't impact the gameplay much, however is noticeable. This scene transition was eliminated in this new version.

Next, the speed and agility of the Pod is also seemingly increased. This helps with hitting boost pads and racing Sebulba at the end of the level.

Also, instead of a breakable barrier leading up to a ramp around halfway through the course, the new level features a Dark-Side Ship door. These doors were introduced in ship levels in [LEGO Star Wars II: The Original Trilogy], and was backported from those levels into this one.

Finally, since there is a minikit up that previously-mentioned ramp, only 9/10 minikits are collectable during Story Mode. In the original version of the level, all 10 minikits were available in Story Mode, meaning the player didn't have to repeat the level in Free Play if they were persistent enough the first time around.

Despite being more difficult, the original version of the level is still available in [LEGO Star Wars: The Complete Saga], however is tucked away as a bonus level.

## Anakin's Flight

Anakin's flight, as featured in a development stage on [YouTube], was a cut level from [LEGO Star Wars: The Video Game] as Episode I had too many levels and this was the least-complete at the time[^youtube_gamehut_lego_star_wars_i_anakins_flight]. This level followed young *Anakin Skywalker* from the end of *Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace* as he flew into the Trade Federation Battleship to blow it up from the inside. This appeared in [LEGO Star Wars: The Complete Saga] as a bonus level with significant changes, however it was the same level in spirit.

## Bounty Hunter Pursuit

Another cut level from [LEGO Star Wars: The Video Game] to be re-developed for [LEGO Star Wars: The Complete Saga] was *Bounty Hunter Pursuit*, following *Anakin Skywalker* and *Obi-Wan Kenobi* as they chase *Zam Wesell* around *Coruscant*. There isn't much known about this version apart from brief mentions in a [YouTube] video from *GameHut*. The channel, run by the previous director of [Traveller's Tales], says the level was cut due "for deadline reasons" [^youtube_gamehut_lego_star_wars_i_anakins_flight]

## Gunship Cavalry

This level also originally featured in [LEGO Star Wars: The Video Game], however like *Mos Espa Podrace*, was modified before it's inclusion in [LEGO Star Wars: The Complete Saga].

Firstly, to note, from what I can tell, the two versions share the same map, most minikits and targets, however the main difference is the control scheme. [LEGO Star Wars: The Video Game]'s vehicles levels all used an 'on rails' approach to handling vehicles, where the level would 'play itself' but the player could move along the remaining two axes and shoot. While other levels acted more like a cinematic (such as *Battle Over Coruscant*), this level required a lot of manoeuvring due to limited camera view but also continually forces the player forward, leading to very difficult situations. The new version of the level incorporates the vehicles mechanics developed for [LEGO Star Wars II: The Original Trilogy] and does not force the player to constantly continue forward.

Secondly, similar to *Mos Espa Podrace*, The original level was also checkpoint-based; if you died in a section, you would have to retry it. This combined with the bad camera/controls made the level very frustrating. This was changed in the new version for the more consistent mechanic of respawning where you died.

Continuing the trend of similar changes, the new version, just like with *Mos Espa Podrace* also added Dark-Side Ship doors to the level. Just as with *Mos Espa Podrace* too, all minikits were collectable in Story Mode, however in the new version, Free Play is required.

Furthering the similarities, the new level also introduced another backported feature from [LEGO Star Wars II: The Original Trilogy] in the form of tow-bombs. Instead of just shooting the shield generators, these bombs would need to be towed into them. This also applied to the end scene; instead of shooting to destroy the generators, you would need to tow a bomb into them.

The final change, also a change we've seen before, is that the timer from the final section was removed, almost certainly because that section with the new mechanics and a timer would be extremely difficult, if not impossible, to finish.

## Bonus Levels

### Episodes Bonuses

Each Episode of [LEGO Star Wars: The Complete Saga] includes three bonus levels: *Super Story*, *Character Bonus* and *Minikit Bonus*. The concept of these bonus levels made their debut in [LEGO Star Wars II: The Original Trilogy]. While it appears the three for Episodes IV, V and VI have been ported directly over, A *Character Bonus* and *Minikit* bonus for Episodes I, II and III had to be created for [LEGO Star Wars: The Complete Saga].

### Bounty Hunter Missions

Also making their debut in [LEGO Star Wars II: The Original Trilogy] were *Bounty Hunter Missions*. It again appears the 10 missions from [LEGO Star Wars II: The Original Trilogy] were directly carried over, however 10 more were created for the prequels.

### New Town

[LEGO Star Wars: The Complete Saga] contains two bonus sandbox levels: *LEGO City* and *New Town*. *LEGO City* was once again brought over from [LEGO Star Wars II: The Original Trilogy], however as far as I can tell, *New Town* is new to [LEGO Star Wars: The Complete Saga].

## Characters

[LEGO Star Wars: The Video Game] has 56 characters while [LEGO Star Wars II: The Original Trilogy] had 68 characters, however there are some that feature in both games. Luckily, [LEGO Star Wars II: The Original Trilogy] had a feature where if you also owned [LEGO Star Wars: The Video Game], the characters from that game that weren't included in the new game were added to the character sheet. This new section contains 46 characters, meaning there are 10 characters that appear in both games. For verification, these 10 characters are:

- C-3P0
- Chewbacca
- Darth Sidious
- Darth Vader
- GNK Droid
- Princess Leia
- R2-D2
- Rebel Trooper
- Stormtrooper
- Yoda

Since there are a total of 114 characters between the two original games, the fact that [LEGO Star Wars: The Complete Saga] has 126 characters shows there are 12 new characters. They are:

- Aayla Secura
- Boss Nass
- Captain Tarpals
- Dexter Jettster
- Indiana Jones
- Lama Su
- Pit Droid
- Plo Koon
- R2-Q5
- Taun We
- Watto
- Zam Wesell

### Vehicles

Just as there were new characters in [LEGO Star Wars: The Complete Saga], there were also new vehicles, however classifying whether one is a 'new' vehicle is a bit more complex than expected. In [LEGO Star Wars: The Video Game], vehicle levels did not have a Free Play mode, thus making vehicles tied to their levels and not accessible throughout. They were never unlocked nor able to be played in any other places. This was changed in [LEGO Star Wars II: The Original Trilogy] where vehicles received their own character sheet, were unlockable and were playable in other levels. Vehicle levels now had Free Play too, meaning you could complete any vehicle level in any vehicle in Free Play - even at times requiring it to collect all minikits.

[LEGO Star Wars: the Video Game] contained four vehicles each in only one level:

- Anakin's Pod (Mos Espa Podrace)
- Anakin's Jedi Starfighter (Battle over Coruscant)
- LAAT Republic Gunship (Gunship Cavalry)
- Obi-Wan's Jedi Starfighter (Battle over Coruscant)

[LEGO Star Wars II: The Original Trilogy] had four vehicle levels plus purchasable vehicles (and one as a 100% reward):

- Darth Vader's TIE Fighter (Purchase)
- Imperial Shuttle (Purchase)
- The Millennium Falcon (Falcon Flight, Into the Death Star)
- Slave I (100%)
- T-47 Snowspeeder (Hoth Battle)
- TIE Bomber (Purchase)
- TIE Fighter (Purchase)
- TIE Interceptor (Purchase)
- X-Wing (Rebel Attack, Falcon Flight, Into the Death Star)
- Y-Wing (Rebel Attack)

All of these vehicles appear in playable form in [LEGO Star Wars: The Complete Saga], with the following additions:

- XJ-6 Airspeeder (Bounty Hunter Pursuit)
- N-1 Starfighter (Anakin's Flight)
- Sebulba's Pod (Purchase)
- Koro-2 Airspeeder (Purchase)
- Droid Tri-Fighter (Purchase)
- Vulture Droid (Purchase)

It also should be noted that, as far as I can tell, the minikit vehicles have been carried over from the two previous games, in [LEGO Star Wars: The Video Game], they were purely decorative while in [LEGO Star Wars: The Complete Saga], they are playable in Minikit Bonus levels.

## Hub

Each of the three games feature a different hub world which forms one of, if not the only piece of content from the two previous games not to make it to [LEGO Star Wars: The Complete Saga]. The hub world from [LEGO Star Wars II: The Original Trilogy] is quite similar to [LEGO Star Wars: The Complete Saga] both being renditions of the same location, however Dexter's Diner is nowhere to be found.

## Extras

Extras changed significantly between [LEGO Star Wars: The Video Game] and [LEGO Star Wars II: The Original Trilogy]. The first game only had the following 10 extras:

- Invincibility
- Silhouettes
- Purple
- Moustaches
- Minikit Detector
- Tea Cups
- Brushes
- Big Blasters
- Classic Blasters
- Silly Blasters

The second game mostly changed these, and had the following:

- Adaptive Difficulty
- Extra Toggle
- Fertiliser
- Disguise
- Daisy Chains
- Chewbacca Carrying C-3P0
- Tow Death Star
- Super Blasters
- Fast Force
- Super Lightsabers
- Tractor Beam
- Invincibility
- Score x2
- Self-Destruct

- Score x4
- Regenerate Hearts
- Minikit Detector
- Score x6
- Super Zapper
- Bounty Hunter Rockets
- Score x8
- Super Ewok Catapult
- Infinite Torpedoes
- Score x10

The first 7 are unlocked by default, however the remaining 18 required a red brick hidden in a specific level to be collected before they could be purchased. Between the two original games, there are only three that are shared between them: *Invincibility*, *Minikit Detector* and *Disguise* (renamed from *Moustaches*), leaving 32 unique extras.

[LEGO Star Wars: The Complete Saga] has the following extras:

- Adaptive Difficulty
- Extra Toggle
- Fertiliser
- Disguise
- Daisy Chains
- Chewbacca Carrying C-3P0
- Tow Death Star
- Silhouettes
- Beep Beep
- Super Gonk

- Super Ewok Catapult
- Infinite Torpedoes
- Score x10

Wow, that's a lot. In total, that's 45 extras; 1 for each of the 36 levels plus 9 unlocked by default. The question is though, are there any missing, and what is new to [LEGO Star Wars: The Complete Saga].

Well, all 25 from [LEGO Star Wars II: The Original Trilogy] are present. Those unlocked from levels are carried over as-is, as are the ones unlocked by default.

However, there are some missing from [LEGO Star Wars: The Video Game]. *Silhouettes* and *Minikit Detector* made the jump unchanged, *Purple* has been renamed and changed slightly into *Super Lightsabers*, *Moustaches* was renamed to *Disguises*, however *Tea Cups*, *Brushes*, *Big Blasters* *Classic Blasters* and *Silly Blasters* are missing from [LEGO Star Wars: The Complete Saga]. These weren't very noteworthy extras, but never-the-less are missing.

## Cutscenes

[LEGO Star Wars: The Complete Saga] saw slight changes to cutscenes from both games. These changes are mostly insignificant and are more akin to tweaks than changes, but never-the-less has been documented in a [YouTube] video[^youtube_mr_cwazie_lego_star_wars_tcs_cutscene_changes].
