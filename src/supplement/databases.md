# Databases

Databases are generally defined for the purposes of this book as a collection for the sole purpose of providing a bank of information. While they may be referenced throughout these investigations, data is never directly taken from these places but their data may form opinions about other pieces of information (i.e., they may be used for verification, not discovery).
