# Companies

For the purposes of this book, a company is an entity (usually an actual company) that was involved in some shape or form with the game. This includes pivotal companies such as [Traveller's Tales] but also important, but less known companies such as [Aspyr Media].

These companies don't have to be behind the game, however. [Valve] is an equally valid company.

## What isn't a Company

Many things aren't classified companies by this book, but some are:

- Outlets ([IGN], etc.): they are documented [separately](./outlets.md)
- Stores ([Steam], etc.): they are documented [separately](./stores.md)
- Tools ([Wikipedia], etc.): they are documented [separately](./tools.md)
