# Entities

For the purposes of this book, a entity is a form of business (usually a company, but occasionally not) that was involved in some shape or form with the game. This includes pivotal entities such as [Traveller's Tales] but also important, but less known entities such as [Aspyr Media].

These entities don't have to be behind the game, however. [Valve] is an equally valid entity.

## What isn't a Entity

Many things aren't classified entities by this book, but some are:

- Outlets ([IGN], etc.): they are documented [separately](./outlets.md)
- Stores ([Steam], etc.): they are documented [separately](./stores.md)
- Tools ([Wikipedia], etc.): they are documented [separately](./tools.md)
