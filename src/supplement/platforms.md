# Platforms

A platform is any Operating System (whether pared with hardware such as the [Xbox] or not such as [Windows]) which any of the discussed games have been released on. In some cases, some platforms that haven't had any releases may be included (e.g., [PlayStation 1] where it may be confusing why the documentation only starts at the [PlayStation 2])
