# Introduction

Welcome to *The Little Book of LEGO Games Investigations*. The aim of this book is to document the research I have done into different games where information about them may be missing, disputed or unclear.

Along with this, a major goal of this book is accuracy. If you stop something that you believe is wrong or could be misinterpreted, please file an issue on [the GitHub page](https://github.com/lachlan2357/little-book-of-lego-games-investigations) for this project.
