# LEGO Star Wars II: The Original Trilogy

A sequel to the original [LEGO Star Wars: The Video Game], *LEGO Star Wars II: The Original Trilogy* revolves around the three original *Star Wars* movies:

- Star Wars Episode VI: A New Hope
- Star Wars Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back
- Star Wars Episode VI: Return of the Jedi

As with [LEGO Star Wars: The Video Game], due to the age (being released in 2006) and obsolescence due to *LEGO Star Wars: The Complete Saga* containing almost all of this game, information can be hard to come across.
