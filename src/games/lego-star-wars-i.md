# LEGO Star Wars: The Video Game

*LEGO Star Wars: The Video Game* was the first of the "LEGO Series" developed by then- Traveller's Tales. Released in 2005, the game centred around the three prequel *Star Wars* movies:

- Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace
- Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones
- Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith

Due to the age of this game and its mostly-obsolete nature since *LEGO Star Wars: The Complete Saga* was released capturing almost all of the content of this game inside, it is difficult to determine fact from reporting error: a fate it's sequel, [LEGO Star Wars II: The Original Trilogy], also suffers from.
