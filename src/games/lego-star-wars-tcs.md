# LEGO Star Wars: The Complete Saga

*LEGO Star Wars: The Complete Saga*, while being a new game in the series, is predominately filled with the content from the previous two LEGO Games: [LEGO Star Wars: The Video Game] and [LEGO Star Wars II: The Original Trilogy]. Thus, it contains the coverage of the following *Star Wars* movies:

- Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace
- Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones
- Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith
- Star Wars Episode VI: A New Hope
- Star Wars Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back
- Star Wars Episode VI: Return of the Jedi

While the game does contain much content from these two previous games, it does contain some original content as explored in an investigation[^investigation_lego_star_wars_tsc_new_content].
