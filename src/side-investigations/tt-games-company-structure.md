# TT Games Company Structure

[TT Games] started off as a small company in 1989, founded by Jon Burton and Andy Ingram[^tt_games_history], however since then have become a large and significant player in the video game landscape.

I will preface this investigation by saying that I myself don't have nearly a comprehensive understanding of the UK Legal System, including how companies are formed, created or disbanded. Being in Australia, this is unlikely to change so while I have tried my best to make sure this information is accurate, I cannot nearly guarantee it.

## Involved Companies

### Traveller's Tales

This small studio incorporated in `1996-01-23` wasn't [TT Games] but [Traveller's Tales] (then *CurrentClass* and now *TT Games Studios*) with UK Company Number `03149992`[^uk_gov_travellers_tales]. It it this company that forms the development team for all the games, evidenced by a capture from the first version of [TT Games]'s website dated `2007-01-22`[^tt_games_history_2007].

### LEGO Interactive

According to their website, [LEGO Interactive] was founded in 1996 called *LEGO Media International*. They claim their headquarters were in or around London, England[^lego_media_company_about]. Despite these headquarters, I cannot find any evidence that they were incorporated in the UK or Denmark, so I am assuming they were an internal division at [The LEGO Group] rather than a separately incorporated company.

According to a [Game Developer] interview with *Jon Burton*, [The LEGO Group] opted-out of the video game market and many of those a part of that studio went to form [Giant Interactive Entertainment][^game_developer_jon_burton_interview].

### Giant Interactive Entertainment

Incorporated on `2003-10-29`, [Giant Interactive Entertainment] (then *Oval (1925)* and *Get-Go-Games*, since *TT Games Publishing* and now *Warner Bros. Games*) has UK Company Number `04946940`[^uk_gov_giant_interactive_entertainment]. Founded by some members of the recently-dissolved [LEGO Interactive], this company held the exclusive rights for LEGO interactively[^game_developer_jon_burton_interview].

### TT Games

It appears, according to their filing history, the merger of [Traveller's Tales] and [Giant Interactive Entertainment] into [TT Games] was planned early `2005` if not late `2004` due to the incorporation of the company being dated `2005-01-24`[^uk_gov_tt_games]. This company appears to be some sort of holding company for it's subsidiaries: not a developer or publisher itself, but the front for these entities.

The merger, according to the filing history for all three companies, happened on `2005-04-07`[^uk_gov_travellers_tales][^uk_gov_giant_interactive_entertainment][^uk_gov_tt_games]. After this, the other companies continued to exist, but were owned completely by [TT Games].

### TT Fusion

Sometime in `2006` (I cannot find when exactly the acquisition happened but my guess is it was `2006-11-21`), [TT Games] acquired *Embryonic Studios* [^uk_gov_tt_fusion], a small development team in the UK[^games_industry_biz_tt_fusion_acquisition] who then became [TT Fusion]. Up until now, [TT Fusion] has seemingly been mostly used to develop handheld ports of the main [Traveller's Tales] games[^lego_bits_n_bricks_s02_e24_transcript], but also some console games such as [LEGO City Undercover][^lego_bits_n_bricks_s02_e24_transcript] and [LEGO Star Wars: The Force Awakens][^daily_motion_lego_star_wars_the_force_awakens_interview].

## So, What Should be Attributed to Who?

Over the course of all the LEGO games, the structure of who-did-what didn't seem to have changed. [Traveller's Tales] developed the games, [Giant Interactive Entertainment] published them, usually both credited under the umbrella of development and publishing being done by [TT Games], even today with the most recent release of [LEGO Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga][^youtube_lego_star_wars_the_skywalker_saga_credits].

However, as we saw with [LEGO City Undercover] and [LEGO Star Wars: The Force Awakens], some games were developed by [TT Fusion], so research has to be done on each game to make sure it was either [Traveller's Tales] or [TT Fusion] (or both, maybe?) who developed the game.

## Other Developers

As found in the investigation into the [LEGO Star Wars: The Video Game] release dates, sometimes external developers are tasked with porting a game to a new platform. In most of those cases, [Traveller's Tales] or [TT Fusion] will be the main developer, with the platform-specific developer being the porting developer, however research should still be done for each case just to be sure. It can be safely assumed, however, that if the ported game is functionally identical, the above is the case.
