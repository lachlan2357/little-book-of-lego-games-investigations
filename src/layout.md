# Layout

A goal of this book is to contain as much missing or disputed information as possible, so things may be a bit dense. Hopefully, the structure of the book can help with that.

## Level 1: Games

Usually, each investigation will only cover a single game. In these cases, the main numbering system caters for each game that has an investigation with a tree of the investigations for that game sub-numbered under it.

Each unique game (including ports where the game shares the same name but is a completely different game) have their own entry as long as there is at least one investigation associated with it. This does mean that an investigation-less game is not present in this book.

## Level 2: Investigations

Each investigation for each game appears as sub-numbered under the game.

For example, a fictional game "Example Game 1" might have investigations into it's publisher and release date. Each investigation is both numbered and order alphabetically, so it may look like the following in the sidebar:

```
1. Example Game 1
	1.1 Publisher
	1.2 Release Date
```

However, sometimes multiple games may share an investigation. In that case, the same page is listed under both however still numbered according to the specific game. There is no way to tell by looking at the list whether the file is the same, however it will share the same URL. It may look like the following in the sidebar:

```
1. Example Game 1
	1.1 Publisher <-- this file is the same ...
	1.2 Release Date
2. Example Game 2
	2.1 Publisher <-- ... as this file
```

## Supplement

Alongside the main section of the book, a supplement section exists below that documents most of the referenced material. For example, information about entities, outlets, platforms, etc. are found here.

While they aren't part of the investigations specifically, they do contain a summary of all the information found through the investigations, so it can be a useful resource to wrap your head around some more of the complex situations.

## Side Investigations

This section contains (usually) smaller investigations that don't have much if anything to do with the franchise but were investigated anyway. They contain some interesting information however does not match the purpose for this book. I have included them because they are interesting to me and I think it is important for the information to be out there, but they aren't a part of the main book.
